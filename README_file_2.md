# Beam Analysis GUI - FSF25 Civil Engineering Module

## Overview

This application is a **PyQt5-based GUI tool** for analyzing a simply supported beam under two moving point loads using **Influence Line Diagrams (ILD)**. It calculates:

- Reactions at supports
- Shear Force and Bending Moment at midspan
- Maximum Shear Force (SF), Bending Moment (BM), and their locations

Plots of ILDs for reactions, SF, and BM are shown for visualization.

## Features

- Transient moving load simulation

# Difficulties Faced:-

‚öôÔ∏è ILD Plotting Logic
Mapping moving loads onto ILDs and syncing with correct beam response was conceptually and technically challenging.

üìä Shear Force Calculation Accuracy
Special care was needed to handle midspan behavior and ensure realistic SF transitions and peak values.

üß© GUI + Backend Integration
Merging PyQt5 interface with numerical engine demanded a clear understanding of signal-slot mechanism.

üìÑ Result Export & Reporting
Structuring outputs for seamless reporting in LaTeX/Overleaf while preserving clarity and consistency was non-trivial.

‚è±Ô∏è Time & Task Management
Delivering GUI, code, documentation, video, and export features under a deadline involved focused planning and iteration.
