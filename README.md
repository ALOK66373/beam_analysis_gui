# Beam Analysis GUI - FSF25 Civil Engineering Module

## Overview

This application is a PyQt5-based GUI tool for analyzing a simply supported beam under two moving point loads using Influence Line Diagrams (ILD). It calculates:
- Reactions at supports
- Shear Force and Bending Moment at midspan
- Maximum SF, BM and their locations

Plots of ILDs for reactions, SF, and BM are shown for visualization.

## Features

- Transient moving load simulation
- ILD-based plotting
- Analysis summary and export
- Report generation ready for Overleaf
- Video demo included

## How to Run

1. Install the dependencies:
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
  

2. Run the main program:
  
   gui_beam_analysis.py
